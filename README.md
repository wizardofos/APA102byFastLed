# APA102byFastLed
A ledstrip of APA102 controlled by a DigiSpark and FastLed library

## Features
This is an Arduino-compatible project, based on a [DigiSpark](http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark)
The goal of this project is to create a small led lightstrip from APA102 leds (only cool-white leds) to
be placed in a shower. The switch will toggle the led strip on/off and, if held down a bit longer, will
dim the light or brighten.

# Technology

* [Arduino] - HTML enhanced for web apps!

And of course this project itself is open source with a [public repository][apa102] on GitHub.

### Dependencies

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Github |        |

### Todos

 - Maybe remove the FastLed altogether to trim down the memory footprint
